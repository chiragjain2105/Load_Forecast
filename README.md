# Load_Forecast using LSTM and SVR
# SVR -> TimerSeries Cross Validation technique and utilizing the load demand data for panama city with an extensive study  of mathematical fundamental involved. 
# The project aimed at developing a robust model capable of day ahead foracasting taking into consideration variable parameters, obtained MAPE - 1.8%
# LSTM -> project aimed at forecasting values for a day ahead (24 hours) based on previous one week load values, obtained MAPE - 7.2 %, MAE - 96.67, MDAPE - 6.7 %
